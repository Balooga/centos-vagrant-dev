## Overview

This Vagrant script will install a full development environment.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required. But will most likely require Administration privileges to install.

1. VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org)

2. Git (https://git-for-windows.github.io)

3. Vagrant (https://wwww.vagrantup.com)

## Installation

1. Ensure that the dependencies listed in the previous section are installed.

2. Clone the vagrant development repository located here (TBD)

3. Enter `vagrant up` at the command-line in the cloned vagrant directory

4. Come back in a couple of hours.

5. Complete the CentOS 7 setup (Choose language, etc.)

## Using the VM

Enter `vagrant up` at the command-line to start the VM.

### Shared Folders
The vagrant virtual machine is configured to share files and folders between the *Host* system, and the *Guest* system. Documents, configurations, and code must be saved within these shared folders and not in the file-system of the *Guest* OS because these will be lost if the virtual machine is deleted.

The shared folder is located in `~/Documents` (`/home/vagrant/Documents`).

### VM Login Details

Login: `vagrant`
Password: `vagrant`
